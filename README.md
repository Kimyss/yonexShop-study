1## Redux 사용 순서
0. Redux Toolkit and React-Redux 설치하기
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux

1. Redux Store 만들기 (app/store.js) **회사나 만드는 곳마다 파일명, 폴더명 다를 수 있어요

2. 리액트에 Redux Store 제공하기 (index.js)

3. Redux State Slice 만들기 (features/product/productSlice.js)

4. Redux Store에 Slice Reducers 추가하기 (app/store.js)

5. 리액트 컴포넌트에서 Redux State와 Actions 사용하기 (features/counter/Counter.js)




## <연습>
1. ProductList 컴포넌트
- text input 하나 만들고 상품명 입력 받기
- 상품 추가 버튼을 누르면 productList 전역 상태에 추가되고 
추가된 상품 리스트가 화면에 렌더링 되도록 만들기
- ProductList 컴포넌트는 ReduxTestApp에서 Counter 밑에 렌더링

2. productSlice 
- 상태 이름: product
- 초기 상태: {
  productList: []
}


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
